## Configuration

ECG needs to be configured with AWS credentials and ECG configuration.

### AWS Credentials

ECG uses the AWS SDK for Go. The SDK will look for credentials in the following
order:

1. Environment variables
2. Shared credentials file (~/.aws/credentials)
    ```
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    ```

### ECG Configuration

ECG can be configured with a configuration file. The default location the configuration
file is looked for is `~/.ecg/config.yaml`. The configuration file can be overridden with
the `-c` flag.

```
log:
  level: "debug"
  # location to write the log file (default is not to have a log file)
  file: "./ecg.log"

anchore:
  url: <your anchore api url> (e.g. http://localhost:8228)
  user: <ecg_inventory_user>
  password: $ECG_ANCHORE_PASSWORD
  http:
    insecure: true
    timeout-seconds: 10
```
